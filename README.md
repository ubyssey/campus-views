# The best view on campus

This project aims to showcase some of most beautiful, iconic, strange and interesting places on campus. We want to capture 360 degree photos & video of 5-7 locations on campus and display them in an interactive page on our website. 

Each view will include a short decsription and an easy-to-use viewer that allows users to pan & zoom the images (think Google Street View).

Ideally this would also include a small minimap that shows where each location is relative to other UBC landmarks.

## Project phases

1. [**Find some places on campus!**](https://github.com/ubyssey/campus-views/issues/1) Make a list of spots on campus that you think are awesome. Once we have a bunch, we'll pick our favourites.

2. [**Take photos of each location.**](https://github.com/ubyssey/campus-views/issues/2) We're going to recruit members of The Ubyssey's photo/video team to help us out with this part. 

3. [**Build an interface for viewing 360 degree photos and video.**](https://github.com/ubyssey/campus-views/issues/3)

4. [**Build a minimap feature that can be used for each location.**](https://github.com/ubyssey/campus-views/issues/4)

5. [**Combine all locations into a single page.**](https://github.com/ubyssey/campus-views/issues/5)

## Examples

Here are some examples to give you an idea of what we're aiming for:

- [Facebook 360 Photos](https://facebook360.fb.com/360-photos/) - We could maybe even use Facebook's embeddable 360 viewer to accomplish phase 3!

- [New York Times - The Daily 360](https://www.nytimes.com/video/the-daily-360)
